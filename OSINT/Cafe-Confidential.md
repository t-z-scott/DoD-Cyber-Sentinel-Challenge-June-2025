**Difficulty: Very Easy**

_Description:_ TBA

_Objective:_ Find the location based on the two photos.

# Completion Steps
1. Download the provided images.
2. To reverse image search (search for an image match) on Google, navigate to google.com and click the camera icon in the search bar. I tried `Image_1.png` first, which returns a result for @/parkers.london on Instagram.
3. For the flag, I still need the street name of this cafe. Clicking around on the search results led me to the Yelp page.

> **Flag:** C1{Parker's_Lowndes}
